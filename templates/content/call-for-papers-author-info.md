The ACM Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) solicits work across a variety of disciplines, including machine learning, statistics, epidemiology, health policy, operations, and economics. CHIL 2021 invites submissions touching on topics focused on relevant problems affecting health. Specifically, authors are invited to submit 8-10 page papers (with unlimited pages for references) to each of the tracks described below.

To ensure that all submissions to CHIL are reviewed by a knowledgeable and appropriate set of reviewers, the conference is divided into tracks and areas of interest. Authors will select exactly one primary track and area of interest when they register their submissions, in addition to one or more sub-disciplines.

Track chairs will oversee the reviewing process. In case you are not sure which track your submission fits under, feel free to contact the track or PC chairs for clarification. The PC Chairs reserve the right to move submissions between tracks and/or areas of interest if the PC believes that a submission has been misclassified.

<br />

### Tracks
- Track 1: Machine Learning: Models, Algorithms, Inference, and Estimation
- Track 2: Applications and Practice: Investigation, Evaluation, Interpretation, and Deployment
- Track 3: Policy: Impact and Society

<br />

### Sub-Disciplines
These are called topics in the submission form. Authors should select one or more discipline(s) in machine learning for health (ML4H) from the following list when submitting their paper: benchmark datasets, distribution shift, transfer learning, population health, social networks, scaleable ML4H systems, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, time series, bias/fairness, causality, *-omics, wearable-data, etc. Peer reviewers are assigned according to expertise in the sub-discipline(s) selected, so please choose your relevant topics carefully.

<br />

### Evaluation
Works submitted to ACM CHIL will be reviewed by 3 reviewers within the broader field of machine learning for healthcare. Reviewers will be asked to primarily judge the work according to four criteria:

**Relevance**: All submissions to ACM CHIL are expected to be relevant to health. Concretely, this means that the problem is well-placed into the relevant themes for the conference. We will instruct reviewers to gauge whether submissions are best suited for this track, or should be moved elsewhere.

**Quality**: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?

**Originality**: Are the tasks or methods new? Is the work a novel combination of well-known techniques? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions? Is related work adequately cited?

**Clarity**: Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? (If not, please make constructive suggestions for improving its clarity.) Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note: a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.)

**Significance**: Are the results important? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?

Final decisions will be made in accordance with the reviewer'sto reviewer’s overall judgement, along with their subjective ratings of confidence/expertise, and according to our own editorial judgement.

### Submission Format and Guidelines
**Submission Site**
Submissions should be made via the online submission system. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the work at the conference in order for the paper to appear in the conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.

**Length and Formatting**
Submitted papers must be 8-10 pages (including all figures and tables), plus unlimited pages for references. Additional supplementary materials (e.g., appendices) can be submitted with their main manuscript. Reviewers will not be required to read the supplementary materials.

Papers should be formatted using the [ACM Master Article Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) and the reference format indicated therein. For LaTeX users, choose format=sigconf. An overleaf template is [included here](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ). ACM also makes a Word template available. Authors do not need to include terms, keywords, or other front matter in their submissions. Papers that are neither in ACM format or exceeding the specified page length, may be rejected without review.

**Archival Submissions**
Submissions to the main conference are considered archival and will appear in the published proceedings of the conference if accepted. Author notification of acceptance will be provided towards mid-February 2021.

<br />

### Peer Review
The review process is double-blind. Please submit completely anonymized drafts. Please do not include any identifying information, and refrain from citing the authors’ own prior work in anything other than third-person. Violations to this policy may result in rejection without review.

Conference organizers and reviewers are required to maintain confidentiality of submitted material. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be released prior to the conference.

<br />

### Camera Ready
For accepted papers, authors will need to provide the following camera-ready materials by March 5:

- Metadata for the eRights system
- Submit forms for approval
- Final versions of papers via FTP
- Dual Submission Policy

You may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar to versions that are currently under review at another conference or journal, have been previously published, or have been accepted for publication. Submissions to the main conference are considered archival and will appear in the published proceedings of the conference if accepted.

An exception to this rule is extensions of workshop papers that have previously appeared in non-archival venues, such as workshops, arXiv, or similar without formal proceedings. These works may be submitted as-is or in an extended form. CHIL also welcomes full paper submission that extend previously published short papers or abstracts, so long as the previously published version does not exceed 4 pages in length. Note that the submission should not cite the workshop/report and preserve anonymity in the submitted manuscript.

<br />

### Open Access
ACM CHIL is committed to open science and ensuring our proceedings are freely available. The conference will make use of the ‘ACM Authorizer “Open Access” Service’ and ‘ACM OpenTOC Service’, allowing unrestricted access to individual papers as well as the overall proceedings, [see here](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess) for more details.
